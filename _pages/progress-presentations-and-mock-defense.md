# PROJECT PROPOSAL PRESENTATION

This first is a formal proposal for what you aim to accomplish with your thesis research by the end of April when your papers are due to the external examiners.

Each presentation will consist of 5 minutes and should clearly include:

* Research question: Why this question? How does your project investigate this question?
* Contextual research
* Practical project description


# MIDTERM PROJECT DEMOS - SCIENCE FAIR

During class you will bring: 
* a _working prototype_ of your project
* a user testing form (preferably Google form) for you to fill out for each user test

The class will run as follows :

* 10 min Group A set up demos

* 60 min Each person has ten minutes to demo individually to members of Group B and pre-thesis students. 

* 10 min Group B set up

* 60 min Repeat with Group B demos





# MOCK DEFENSE PRESENTATION

This is a general guideline for your mock thesis defense. You can obviously change this to suit your project's needs. 
You have 20 minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes for discussion. 

For a 20 minute presentation, plan on about 20 slides. The presentation should cover all the sections in your paper. 

* Introduce yourself \(as if we did not know you.\)

* Introduction (1-2 slides)

* Background: Show your influences \(Literature Research and Competitive or Comparative Analysis\) (3-4 slides)

* Define the context of your project: open question in the field, or an unmet need. ( 1-2 slides)

* Describe the project and rationale: place your project in the context of what you have just described, and how it addresses that question or need.
Discuss how your project is advancing your chosen area. (1-2 slides)

* Show Research, Design, and Development \(including project iterations, user testing, results\) (6-8 slides)

* Conclusions (1-2 slides)

* Discuss Plans or Wishes for Future Iterations (1-2 slides)
