# THESIS PAPER

The Thesis Paper is a written document that covers the content of the following conversation related to your Thesis Project:

**Q1: what is your project?**

**You:** I'm interested in\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. \[INTRODUCTION\]

**Q2: Oh yeah? I don't know anything about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .**

**You:** The state of the art in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is ... \[BACKGROUND\]

**Q3: Cool. So what are you making?**

**You:** I'm making a thing, that is a novel contribution to the field of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. \[PROJECT\] 
I'm approaching it in this way \[METHODOLOGIES\] 
This is how I made it. \[METHODS\]

**Q4: Rad. Does it work?**

**You**: I assessed it in this way, changed it, then assessed it in that way, changed it, and now it works like this. \[TESTING/RESULTS\]

**Q5: Ok, what does that mean?**

**You**: These results show that this thing is important to the field of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for these reasons. \[CONCLUSION\]

Next, I'll do this with it. \[FUTURE PERSPECTIVES\]



We will be workshopping in class each stage to get you to your final written document. Below are descriptions of each section that may appear in your final paper.

The paper should be at least 60 pages, and the maximum length is 120 pages \(including images, figures and charts\).



# Abstract

* Write it last!

* Identify the field in which you are operating, and the problem/issue that you addressed

* Describe your project

* Outline your research methods

* State your main findings/conclusion\(s\)

* Indicate your recommendations for future perspectives

* Include keywords

* Keep to one page or less

# 1. Introduction 

Describe the field or topic you are interested in. Describe the state of the art of the field in a way that someone who knows nothing about it has sufficient information to understand the importance of your project. You should reference previously published papers, projects made by others, books or other literature.

Everything in this section must be properly cited.

# 2. Background

Here you give your reader the specific information related to the topic of interest that they need to know to understand the importance of your project. You can describe similar projects or products that are the competition. This can include, but is not limited to:

Here you discuss in scholarly detail the work that has been done in this field and how it leads you to your research question. You should interpret, synthesize, relate these works in a reflective and scholarly manner: what you say here is a NOVEL interpretation of the references you have collected, taken as a whole, not a paraphrase. 

The background section leads to an open question in the field, or an unmet need. End it by a statement that places your project in the context of what you have just described, and how it addresses that question or need.

Everything in this section must be properly cited.

# 3. Project
The Project section has several sub-sections, listed below

## 3.1 Description and Rationale

Summarize here your project - is it a game, a VR piece, an installation? How does it work and who uses it? 
Describe how the overall design of this project addresses the open question you arrived to in your Background section. 

## 3.2 Methodologies

Describe the methodologies you have used to approach your research question. Refer to List of Methodologies in the class resource folder for an (incomplete) list of possible methodologies to use. 

## 3.3 Methods

Describe in detail how you made your project, and each subsequent iteration. This needs to have enough detail that someone could reproduce it exactly, without having seen it. Think Instructables tutorial.

* parts numbers
* code
* materials
* tools

This section also covers how you assessed it:

* experimental setup
* user testing 
* data collection
* data analysis
* any intrinsic limitations or biases in these methods

This should be done for each iteration \(Pilot 1, 2, 3; Experiment 1, 2, 3; Prototype alpha, beta, gold\). This section is purely descriptive, and you do not go into interpretation of the results.

## 3.4 Results and discussion

Describe in detail how you have assessed the performance of your project, and the results of that assessment.  Depending on the project, this could be one or more of:

* a measurement \(how high did my hot air ballon rise?\)
* user testing \(how long did my users take to figure out my app/game?\)
* audience feedback \(did my audience understand the message conveyed by my installation/performance?\)
* hypothesis \(in\)validation \(did my experiment disprove my hypothesis?\)
* performance analysis \(did my car drive itself in the way I designed it to? did my algorithm execute faster than the competition?\)

Use figures, plots, images to illustrate the results described.

For each _assessment_ discuss how these results can be interpreted with respect to the goal set in your introduction.

Describe how, given the results, you redesigned/altered/reassessed your project.

The conclusions for each iteration can be:

* Compare data/findings against your Literature Review, Related Work, or Competitive Analysis findings.

* Summarize main empirical findings

* Place evidence of \(non-confidential\) empirical research in appendices \(questionnaires, interview transcripts/notes, experiment results, etc.\)

For clarity, you can name each iteration \(Pilot 1, 2, 3; Experiment 1, 2, 3; Prototype alpha, beta, gold\)

# 

# 4. Conclusion

* Remind reader of your initial research objectives

* Summarize Literature Review, Comparative Analysis, and Research findings as related to research objectives.

* Elicit main conclusions from your findings, and how they fit with aforementioned summary

# 5. Future Perspectives

* Offer recommendations for next steps in this investigation. If you were handing off this project to someone, where should they start? What initial questions did you not answer? What questions arose that are new?
