# THESIS PROCESS WEBSITE

You should have a dedicated, thesis website to document your weekly progress/process of your MS Thesis \(ideally in wordpress\) on [http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu](http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/). If you do not use sites.bxmc.poly.edu, you'll need to post your process pdf on sites.bxmc.poly.edu at the end of the semester for archival purposes.

* Students are expected to share their progress with the instructor and class using their process website.

* You can receive web space from IDM’s Technology Manager, Elton Kwok, MAGNET 883. Email eltonkwok@nyu.edu to set up an appointment for your web space.

* IDM’s FTP server info: [http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu](http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/)\(Use active mode to connect\)

* Create a thesis folder

* Install wordpress in this folder

* Make an appointment with Elton to connect a database to this particular wordpress installation

## What your thesis process website should contain
* Weekly Thesis Progress/Process

  * at least, **1 post per week DUE at noon on Tuesdays**. If it is not posted by noon, you will not receive credit.
  * The majority of the posts should be your own writing \(well-composed and proofread for impeccable spelling and grammar\).
  * Project Advisor meeting notes \(2-4x\)
  * Accountability partner meeting notes
  * pdfs of any presentations \(annotated\)
  * notes taken about your project, paper, and presentations by you or your accountability partner
  * Milestones / Tasks that have been completed \(transcribed from your personal kanban\)
  * Include who or what was involved.

_If you do not do anything for the week, write I did not work on my thesis this week._

* An About Page \(about you\)
* The “elevator pitch” / Thesis Statement

* Pre-thesis:
  * A link to your pre-thesis site
  * A link to a pdf of your pre-thesis defense presentation
  * Documentation \(i.e. hi-res images and/or video\) of your prototype from pre-thesis



* Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration

  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences is more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your thesis. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.\)

## What your thesis process website should NOT contain

* How you are feeling about your MS thesis? This is different than evaluating or reflecting about what is working and what is not working. In other words, don’t rant, complain, blame, self-deprecate or make excuses on your thesis website.

* This is a public representation of you as an artist, designer, creative technologist and/or entrepreneur. You want it to be as professional as possible. You want prospective employers, gallery owners, venture capitalists, and/or possible collaborators to take you seriously.

* Any content that is NOT related to your thesis explicitly.
