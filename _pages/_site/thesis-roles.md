# Thesis Roles

Your thesis is under the guidance of faculty and a community of peers, both inside and outside the university, who play a number of roles:

### Thesis Faculty \(Elizabeth Henaff\)

* The Thesis Faculty is the primary critic and mentor throughout the thesis process.

### Thesis Writing Instructor \(Liz McEnaney, liz.mcenaney@gmail.com\)

* The role of the writing instructor is to help students write their thesis paper. Liz will lead in class sessions on writing as well as deliver support in small group tutorials.

### Thesis Project Advisor

* The Thesis Project Advisor will meet with their Thesis Project Advisee at least 2 times \(or more depending on the project advisor's preference and availability\) throughout the semester to give feedback on the thesis paper, project, and/or defense presentation.

* A learning contract is encouraged to give both advisor/advisee a written document of expectations.

* The Thesis Student will document the meetings \(date, time, length, and typed notes\) on their process website.

* The Thesis Project Advisor will be the primary recommender for the external reviewer.

* The Thesis Project Advisor agrees to attend the Thesis Defense Panel, and will be given a digital copy of the student's final thesis paper for review **at least one week BEFORE** the Defense.

* The Thesis Defense will be scheduled at a time that is good for the Thesis Project Advisor AND the External Reviewer. Date, Time, and Room to be determined.

### External Reviewer

* Reviewer is identified in consultation with the Thesis Project Advisor

* The qualifications of an external examiner are professional experience and expertise in your subject area.

* They should be local \(in NYC\).

* Ideally they are external to NYU \(the best case scenario\), if not external to IDM.

* The student will contact the external to ask if they will join the examination panel.

* The External Reviewer will attend the student's Thesis Defense Panel, and will be given a digital copy of the student's thesis paper for review **at least one week BEFORE**  the Defense.

### Your Thesis Accountability Partner

* You will partner with a classmate for moral support, ideation, proofreading, presentation practice, and most importantly to stay on task.

### Thesis Peers

* Your fellow graduate students are considered to be peers in the discussion and dialogue of your thesis. Students are strongly encouraged to share research and resources as well as critique from their peers.

* Utilize IDM's grad studio MAGNET 804 to hold informal critiques, mock presentations, and discussion outside of class.
