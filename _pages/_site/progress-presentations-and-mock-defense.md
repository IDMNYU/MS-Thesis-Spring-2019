# PROJECT PROPOSAL PRESENTATION

This first is a formal proposal for what you aim to accomplish with your thesis research by the end of April when your papers are due to the external examiners.

Each presentation will consist of  
• 10 minutes of presentation  
• 10 minutes of critique  
for 20 minutes total.

It should clearly include:

* Research question: Why this question? How does your project investigate this question?
* Contextual research: literature and theory, as well as other projects from your fields/domains
* Practical project description: what are you making?
* Methodology and methods for your primary research: how are you exploring your research questions? How will you find results?
* Timeline for achieving this project: include specific dates, especially for functional demos and user testing
* Resources needed to achieve this research
* Bibliography

# MIDTERM PROJECT DEMOS - SCIENCE FAIR

During class you will bring: 
* a _working prototype_ of your project
* a user testing form (preferably Google form) for you to fill out for each user test

The class will run as follows :

* 10 min Group A set up demos

* 60 min Each person has ten minutes to demo individually to members of Group B and pre-thesis students. 

* 10 min Group B set up

* 60 min Repeat with Group B demos





# MOCK DEFENSE PRESENTATION

This is a general guideline for your mock thesis defense. You can obviously change this to suit your project's needs. 
You have 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for discussion. 

* Introduce yourself \(as if we did not know you.\)

* State Research Aims

* DEMO YOUR PROJECT

* Show Your Influences \(Competitive or Comparative Analysis of at least 3 other examples of work in the same space\)

* Discuss how your project is advancing your chosen area

* Show Research, Design, and Development \(including project iterations and identify your collaborators by name\)

* Discuss User Testing

* Discuss Findings

* Discuss Plans or Wishes for Future Iterations
