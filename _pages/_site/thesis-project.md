# THESIS PROJECT

Your Thesis Project is a Thing: it can be an object, app, game, performance, experiment, machine, algorithm, installation ... or anything else of your creation.

It is designed to address your research question.

Intrinsic to its design is assessing how well it answers your research question.

If it is a device that is meant to be interacted with, be sure to account for user testing in the timeline of your project.

The Science Fair Demo is an opportunity to user test.

### Expect to Iterate.

Nothing is perfect the first time, and you should expect to iterate your project to get closer to your research goals. Iteration is a key element to the Project and the Paper, and be sure to document your iterations carefully.

**Each iteration of the Project should be tested, and the results recorded and discussed.**
