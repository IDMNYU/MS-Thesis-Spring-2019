# Assignments 

All assignments are due Mondays at 5pm, uploaded to our shared Google Drive folder (MS-Thesis-Deliverables_yourname) unless specified otherwise. 

Updates to your process website are to be submitted using [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/Dx43egoBKwrYKAx63). 

### Week 2: 

- List of references

    Submit a Google Doc or Word file with at least 5 references. These can be journal articles, books, essays or websites - but you must have at least 3 that are scholarly publications (books or essays that are critical or theoretical in nature). 
    Annotate each one with a 2-3 sentence description of how this publication informs your work. 
    
    For example:
    
    "Haraway, D. J. _The companion species manifesto : dogs, people, and significant otherness._

    In this essay, Donna Haraway discusses the implosion of nature and culture in the joint lives of dogs and people, who are bonded in 'significant otherness.' This text investigates the notions of co-evolution, and is relevant to my project that aims to design a set of objects for interspecies communication for a speculative but not too distant future. "

    This assignment accounts for 10% of your grade, according to the following rubric:

    relevance of references | 5pts
    quality of annotations | 5pts
    total | 10pts



- Set up a process website hosted on BxMC server. 

    Make an account on the server by [submitting a request to Elton Kwok](http://bxmc.poly.edu/techsupport/?page_id=67). Then submit a link to your first post with [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/Dx43egoBKwrYKAx63). 

- [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11y_CpDV2P5P554JwUzz0TECME22D1JCtsIxnAHnvI3I/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of pre-approved advisors for MS Thesis. Please peruse this carefully, look at their work and then [submit your top 3 choices](https://goo.gl/forms/Fsx3jgsf74jVNh7E2).

    We will then assign an advisor to each of you according to these preferences by the end of next week. 

    If you have another advisor in mind, have them fill out the form linked in the [Thesis Roles section of the syllabus](https://idmnyu.github.io/MS-Thesis-Spring-2019/_pages/thesis-roles.html) and send me a note so that I may review their application. 

### Week 3:

    The outline corresponds to your future Table of Contents. Refer to our shared class folder for [examples of past theses](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1H8sbVdIDZ62vrR7rS3YcGQSOScM7q8e0) and their tables of contents.
