# Thesis Roles

Your thesis is under the guidance of faculty and a community of peers, both inside and outside the university, who play a number of roles:

### Thesis Instructor \(Elizabeth Henaff and Mark Skywarek\)

The Thesis Instructor leads courses and workshops throughout the semester, sets deadlines for deliverables, and gives the final grade for the thesis class. 

### Thesis Writing Instructor \(Liz McEnaney, liz.mcenaney@gmail.com\)

The role of the writing instructor is to help students write their thesis paper. Liz will lead in class sessions on writing as well as give individual feedback on your writing. Any written deliverables should be sent to her, and her comments integrated, BEFORE turning it in to your professor.
