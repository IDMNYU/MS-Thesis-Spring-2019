<h5 id="qualitative-grading-overview">QUALITATIVE GRADING OVERVIEW</h5>

<p><strong>You will be judged on the quality, iteration, completion, and presentation of your thesis.</strong></p>

<h6 id="a-excellent-90-100"><strong>A. Excellent (90-100)</strong></h6>

<p>Your performance and attendance has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Your thesis clearly differentiates itself from other work. Your thesis has memorable impact, and pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond average goals. The ideas behind your thesis are original, thoughtful and/or imaginative. Spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors are non-existent. Your thesis demonstrates your ability to think critically and work independently. Your thesis also demonstrates the use of strong methods and process.</p>

<p>Your performance and attendance has been good, though not of the highest level. Your thesis is better than average and shows extra effort. The impact of your thesis is good, and demonstrates the utilization of the iterative process. Your thesis employs above average craft and attention to detail.</p>

<p>Your performance and attendance has been less than adequate. Your thesis is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of the research, design, and/or prototyping phase(s). The impact of your thesis is weak with unsound, unoriginal, or unimaginative thinking. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and/or poor craft.</p>

<h6 id="f-unacceptable-59--below"><strong>F. Unacceptable (59 &amp; Below)</strong></h6>

<p>The performance &amp; attendance of the student has not met course requirements. Your thesis shows no overall understanding of the research, design, and/or prototyping phase(s) on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.</p>

<h5 id="attendance-and-assignments"><strong>Attendance and Assignments</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>Attendance is mandatory during project critiques, individual status meetings, and every student’s end of semester public presentations. If you miss an individual status meeting, it is your responsibility to exchange a time with a fellow classmate.</li>
  <li>Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="academic-honesty"><strong>ACADEMIC HONESTY</strong></h3>

<p>Please review <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/code-of-conduct/academic-dishonesty">NYU’s School of Engineering’s academic dishonesty policy</a> in its entirety.</p>

<p>All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words, media, or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. D is also the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual of Style for citing and documenting source material.</p>

<p>You MUST have complete rights of use to any and all materials which appear in your thesis project. This includes images, illustrations, audio etc. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be properly cited. Please remember that you can collaborate with other students to create your own media or contact the authors of your media selections for rights. I strongly encourage you to use original media for your thesis project, however should you absolutely require to use stock images, video, etc., you will need to provide a PDF of all source files and the usage rights you have purchased/negotiated or whether it is creative commons or copyright free.</p>
